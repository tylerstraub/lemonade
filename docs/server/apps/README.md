# Lemonade Server Examples

Many applications today utilize OpenAI models like ChatGPT through APIs such as:

`POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

This API call triggers the ChatGPT model to generate responses for a chat. With Lemonade Server, we are replacing the OpenAI endpoint with a local LLM. The new API call becomes:

`POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/completions`

This allows the same application to leverage local LLMs instead of relying on OpenAI's cloud-based models. The guides in this folder show how to connect Lemonade Server to popular applications to enable local LLM execution. To run these examples, you'll need a Windows PC.
