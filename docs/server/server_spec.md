# Lemonade Server Spec

The `lemonade` SDK provides a standards-compliant server process that provides a REST API to enable communication with other applications.

Lemonade Server currently supports two backends:

| Backend                                                                 | Model Format | Description                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ONNX Runtime GenAI (OGA)](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai) | `.ONNX`      | Lemonade's built-in server, recommended for standard use on AMD platforms.                                                |
| [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) _(Experimental)_    | `.GGUF`      | Uses llama.cpp's Vulkan-powered llama-server backend. More details [here](#experimental-gguf-support).                    |


## OGA Endpoints Overview

Right now, the [key endpoints of the OpenAI API](#openai-compatible-endpoints) are available.

We are also actively investigating and developing [additional endpoints](#additional-endpoints) that will improve the experience of local applications.

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints
- POST `/api/v1/chat/completions` - Chat Completions (messages -> completion)
- POST `/api/v1/completions` - Text Completions (prompt -> completion)
- POST `api/v1/responses` - Chat Completions (prompt|messages -> event)
- GET `/api/v1/models` - List models available locally

### Additional Endpoints

> 🚧 These additional endpoints are a preview that is under active development. The API specification is subject to change.

These additional endpoints were inspired by the [LM Studio REST API](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/api/endpoints/openai), [Ollama API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md), and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

They focus on enabling client applications by extending existing cloud-focused APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to also include the ability to load and unload models before completion requests are made. These extensions allow for a greater degree of UI/UX responsiveness in native applications by allowing applications to:

- Pre-load models at UI-loading-time, as opposed to completion-request time.
- Load models from the local system that were downloaded by other applications (i.e., a common system-wide models cache).
- Unload models to save memory space.

The additional endpoints under development are:

- POST `/api/v1/pull` - Install a model
- POST `/api/v1/load` - Load a model
- POST `/api/v1/unload` - Unload a model
- POST `/api/v1/params` - Set generation parameters
- GET `/api/v1/health` - Check server health
- GET `/api/v1/stats` - Performance statistics from the last request
- GET `/api/v1/system-info` - System information and device enumeration

> 🚧 We are in the process of developing this interface. Let us know what's important to you on Github or by email (lemonade at amd dot com).

## Start the REST API Server

> **NOTE:** This server is intended for use on local systems only. Do not expose the server port to the open internet.

### Windows Installer

See the [Lemonade Server getting started instructions](./README.md). 

### Python Environment

If you have Lemonade [installed in a Python environment](https://lemonade-server.ai/install_options.html), simply activate it and run the following command to start the server:

```bash
lemonade-server-dev serve
```

#### Streaming Events

The Responses API uses semantic events for streaming. Each event is typed with a predefined schema, so you can listen for events you care about. Our initial implementation only offers support to:

- `response.created`
- `response.output_text.delta`
- `response.completed`

For a full list of event types, see the [API reference for streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming).

### `GET /api/v1/models` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Returns a list of key models available on the server in an OpenAI-compatible format. We also expanded each model object with the `checkpoint` and `recipe` fields, which may be used to load a model using the `load` endpoint.

This [list](./server_models.md) is curated based on what works best for Ryzen AI Hybrid. Only models available locally are shown.

#### Parameters

This endpoint does not take any parameters.

#### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/models
```

#### Response format

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
      "created": 1744173590,
      "object": "model",
      "owned_by": "lemonade",
      "checkpoint": "amd/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-quantized_int4-float16-cpu-onnx",
      "recipe": "oga-cpu"
    },
    {
      "id": "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Hybrid",
      "created": 1744173590,

      "recipe": "oga-hybrid"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Additional Endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/pull` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Register and install models for use with Lemonade Server.

#### Parameters

The Lemonade Server built-in model registry has a collection of model names that can be pulled and loaded. The `pull` endpoint can install any registered model, and it can also register-then-install any model available on Hugging Face.

**Install a Model that is Already Registered**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | [Lemonade Server model name](./server_models.md) to install. |

Example request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Installed model: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

**Register and Install a Model**

Registration will place an entry for that model in the `user_models.json` file, which is located in the user's Lemonade cache (default: `~/.cache/lemonade`). Then, the model will be installed. Once the model is registered and installed, it will show up in the `models` endpoint alongside the built-in models and can be loaded.

The `recipe` field defines which software framework and device will be used to load and run the model. For more information on OGA and Hugging Face recipes, see the [Lemonade API README](../lemonade_api.md). For information on GGUF recipes, see [llamacpp](#experimental-gguf-support).

> Note: the `model_name` for registering a new model must use the `user` namespace, to prevent collisions with built-in models. For example, `user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF`.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | Namespaced [Lemonade Server model name](./server_models.md) to register and install. |
| `checkpoint` | Yes | HuggingFace checkpoint to install. |
| `recipe` | Yes | Lemonade API recipe to load the model with. |
| `reasoning` | No | Whether the model is a reasoning model, like DeepSeek (default: false). |
| `mmproj` | No | Multimodal Projector (mmproj) file to use for vision models. |

Example request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF",
    "checkpoint": "unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
    "recipe": "llamacpp"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Installed model: user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

### `POST /api/v1/delete` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

# Debugging

To help debug the Lemonade server, you can use the `--log-level` parameter to control the verbosity of logging information. The server supports multiple logging levels that provide increasing amounts of detail about server operations.

```
lemonade-server serve --log-level [level]
```

Where `[level]` can be one of:

- **critical**: Only critical errors that prevent server operation.
- **error**: Error conditions that might allow continued operation.
- **warning**: Warning conditions that should be addressed.
- **info**: (Default) General informational messages about server operation.
- **debug**: Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting, including metrics such as input/output token counts, Time To First Token (TTFT), and Tokens Per Second (TPS).
- **trace**: Very detailed tracing information, including everything from debug level plus all input prompts.

# Experimental GGUF Support

The OGA models (`*-CPU`, `*-Hybrid`) available in Lemonade Server use Lemonade's built-in server implementation. However, Lemonade SDK v7.0.1 introduced experimental support for [llama.cpp's](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) Vulkan `llama-server` as an alternative backend for CPU and GPU.

The `llama-server` backend works with Lemonade's suggested `*-GGUF` models, as well as any .gguf model from Hugging Face. Windows and Ubuntu Linux are supported. Details:
- Lemonade Server wraps `llama-server` with support for the `lemonade-server` CLI, client web app, and endpoints (e.g., `models`, `pull`, `load`, etc.).
  - The `chat/completions`, `embeddings`, and `reranking` endpoints are supported. 
  - Non-chat `completions`, and `responses` are not supported at this time.
- A single Lemonade Server process can seamlessly switch between OGA and GGUF models.
  - Lemonade Server will attempt to load models onto GPU with Vulkan first, and if that doesn't work it will fall back to CPU.
  - From the end-user's perspective, OGA vs. GGUF should be completely transparent: they wont be aware of whether the built-in server or `llama-server` is serving their model.

## Installing GGUF Models

To install an arbitrary GGUF from Hugging Face, open the Lemonade web app by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser and click the Model Management tab.
