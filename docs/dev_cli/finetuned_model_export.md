# Bring Your Own Finetuned Model Guide

Bring your own finetuned model into the Ryzen™ AI ecosystem and run it locally! This guide walks you through the steps to quantize your model and export it for optimized performance with ONNX Runtime GenAI on AMD Ryzen AI devices.

**Workflow Summary:**

1. **Finetune your model** (using your preferred framework)
2. **Quantize** using Quark's PTQ flow
3. **Export and run** the quantized model using Lemonade, then deploy it with ONNX Runtime GenAI on Ryzen™ AI-enabled devices.

## Step 1: Quantize Your Finetuned Model with Quark

### 1.1 Install Quark

- Follow the [Quark installation guide](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/install.html) to download and set up Quark.
- It is highly recommended to use GPU acceleration for quantizing LLMs, as CPU-based quantization can be time-consuming. Refer to the [PyTorch GPU support section](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/install.html#install-pytorch-with-gpu-support) for setup instructions.

- Quark provides a pre-prepared examples folder to simplify the quantization process. Download the latest zip file matching your Quark version from the [previous versions section](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/install.html#previous-versions-of-amd-quark). After extracting the folder, navigate to `examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq` to find `quantize_quark.py`.

- For detailed instructions on using PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) with Quark, refer to the [Quark PyTorch LLM PTQ example](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/example_quark_torch_llm_ptq.html).


### 1.2 Prepare Your Model

- Ensure your finetuned model checkpoint is available locally (e.g., `[MODEL_DIR]`) or from a supported HuggingFace repo (e.g., `google/gemma-2-2b`).

### 1.3 Quantization Strategy

For LLMs targeting Ryzen AI, the recommended quantization strategy is:

- **AWQ** (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)
- **Asymmetric quantization**
- **Activations:** BF16/FP16/FP32
- **Weights:** UINT4
- **Export:** HuggingFace Transformers format 

### 1.4 Example Quantization Commands

```bash
python quantize_quark.py --model_dir $MODEL_DIR \
    --output_dir <path/to/output/model> \
    --quant_scheme w_uint4_per_group_asym \
    --num_calib_data 128 \
    --quant_algo awq \
    --dataset pileval_for_awq_benchmark \
    --model_export hf_format \
    --group_size 128 \
    --group_size_per_layer lm_head 32 \
    --data_type float16 \
    --exclude_layers
```

**Result:** This will generate a quantized safetensors model in your output directory.

## Step 2: Export to ONNX for Ryzen AI

Lemonade handles export and device specialization automatically. It detects model type and target device, exporting optimally for AMD hardware.

Install support in Lemonade with:

```bash
pip install lemonade-sdk[dev,oga-ryzenai,model-generate] --extra-index-url https://pypi.amd.com/simple
```

### Usage

```bash
lemonade -i <quantized_checkpoint> oga-load --device <hybrid|npu> --dtype int4 [options]
```

**Example using quantized model with prompt tool:**

```bash
lemonade -i amd/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-awq-uint4-asym-g128-bf16-lmhead oga-load --device hybrid --dtype int4 llm-prompt -p "Alice and Bob" --max-new-tokens 10
```

Here, we have quantized the `Llama3.2-1B-Instruct` model using AWQ with a uint4 asymmetric quantization strategy and BF16 activations and uploaded it to Hugging Face. Now, using Lemonade, we’re running inference with the built-in prompt tool on this fine-tuned, quantized model. Under the hood, Lemonade handles model export and optimization to ensure optimal inference.


## Best Practices & Notes

- **Model Compatibility:** Ensure your model architecture is supported by Ryzen AI and Quark. Refer to the [supported model list](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/llm/overview.html#featured-llms) for details.
- **Quantization Parameters:** Adjust group size, data type, and quantization scheme as needed for your use case.
- **Output Verification:** After quantization and export, validate model performance on your target device. Check this [notebook](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/blob/main/examples/notebooks/lemonade_model_validation.ipynb) out to verify your export
- **Documentation:** Refer to [Quark documentation](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/) and Lemonade's help (`lemonade --help`) for advanced options.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors during quantization or export, check that all dependencies are installed and your model checkpoint is accessible.
- For device-specific issues, consult the AMD forums or Ryzen AI documentation.
